## 👋 Hi, I’m Izildo

I’m a developer with a strong interest in **mobile and cross-platform development**, working with technologies that scale across Android, iOS, and desktop. I enjoy building everything from **business-focused applications** to **game-related tools and experiences**.

### 🔧 What I’m focusing on
- Strengthening my skills in **Unity game development**
- Expanding my knowledge of **C# and the .NET ecosystem**
- Learning how to build **clean, scalable backends** that support multiplatform apps

### 🎯 What I’m looking for
I’m open to collaborating on projects — whether it’s mobile apps, Unity game prototypes, or .NET-based tools — so I can keep growing my experience as a developer.

### 🚀 Why .NET + Unity?
The .NET ecosystem gives me the power to build **cross-platform applications**, while Unity lets me explore **interactive and game development**. Combining both allows me to create applications, prototypes, and tools that work on multiple platforms with one tech stack.
